 * Description: Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.
 * We denote its area by  $S$ , the number of points with integer coordinates lying 
 * strictly inside the polygon by  $I$  and the number of points lying on 
 * polygon sides by $B$ .
 * Then, the Pick's formula states:
 * $$S=I+\frac{B}{2}-1$$
